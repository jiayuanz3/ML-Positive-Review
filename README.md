# This review sounds positive

This is a piece work from COMP30027 Machine Learning Project 2(University of Melborune).

I finished this work in 06/2020 with Python programming.

In this Project, I build and analyse some supervised Machine Learning methods, to predict star ratings (1, 3, or 5) for reviews on restaurants. 

code.ipynb is the code file, dataset folder contains all used datasets and prediction folder has the predicted results with different models
